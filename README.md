# 📍 Spots

## 📝 Project Overview

**Spots** is a responsive social media web application that allows users to create, like, and delete photo posts, as well as update their profiles. This project challenged me to translate a Figma design into code without a full written brief—strengthening my ability to interpret UI specs visually and implement them in a functional, accessible interface.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Ensure the design is fully responsive and functional across desktop and mobile devices.
- Implement core social media features including posting, editing profiles, and liking photos.
- Prepare for future enhancements including tablet optimization and cross-browser compatibility.

## 🌟 Key Features

- Responsive layout (mobile-first, desktop-optimized)
- Grid-based card layout for photo posts
- Profile management (edit avatar, name, and description)
- Add and delete photos
- Like/unlike photo posts
- Real-time updates and feedback
- RESTful API integration
