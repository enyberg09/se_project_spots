# Spots

## Description

I have finished my third project with TripleTen. This project is called Spots. Spots is a responsive social media web application where users can add and remove photos, like photos, and make profile adjustments

With this project, I was introduced to working with Figma rather than a full brief that gives detailed specifications. I enjoyed the challenge of finding the necessary specifications to recreate the design and how to translate that to code.

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to ensure that all elements of the design display correctly across popular screen sizes, such as desktop and mobile. Moving forward, I will be fine-tuning the design to ensure itâ€™s also compatible with tablet devices.

## Project Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop and mobile)
- Grid-based photo card layout
- Custom fonts implementation

## Tech Stack

In this portion of my project, I have implemented media queries to help the display be compatible with desktop view and mobile views. Here are the technologies used:

- **HTML**: Structure of the content
- **CSS**: Styling the layout and components
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the design is mobile-first and adapts to different screen sizes
- **BEM**: Using Block-Element-Modifier methodology for better CSS organization and maintainability
