# Project 3: Spots

# Spots - share an image of it

## Describe pro ject and its functionality

I have finished my third project with TripleTen. This project is called Spots.

With this project, I was introduced to working with Figma rather than a full brief that gives detailed specifications. I enjoyed the challenge of finding the necessary specifications to recreate the design and how to translate that to code.

The goal of this portion project is to ensure all elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes such as desktop and mobile. As time goes on with the course, I will be fine-tuning this page and also making it compatible with tablet devices.

## Tech Stack

In this portion of my project, I have implemented media queries to help the display be compatible with desktop view and mobile view.

- html, css, responsive design

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
